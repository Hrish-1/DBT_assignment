Exercise 2
1. Select from any table a number and determine whether it is within a given range (for
example, between 1 and 10).

>	delimiter //
		create procedure range1(a int,b int)
		begin
		    declare x int;
		    declare r varchar(50);
			select sal into x from emp where ename = 'D';
			if x between a and b then
				set r = concat(x," is within the given range ",a," and ",b);
				insert into tempp values (r);
			else
				set r = concat(x," is not within the given range ",a," and ",b);
				insert into tempp values (r);
			end if;
		end; //
	delimiter ;

2. Select from any table three positive integers representing the sides of a triangle, and
determine whether they form a valid triangle. Hint: In a triangle, the sum of any two
sides must always be greater than the third side.

> delimiter //
 		create procedure triangle(a int,b int,c int)
 		begin
 			 declare x int;
 			 declare y int;
 			 declare z int;
 			 select sal into x from emp where empno = a;
 			 select sal into y from emp where empno = b;
 			 select sal into z from emp where empno = c;

 			 if (x + y) > z and (x + z) > y and (z + y) > x then
 			 	insert into tempp values ("Triangle is valid");
 			 else
 			 	insert into tempp values ("Triangle is not valid");
 		     end if;
 		end; //
 		delimiter ;


3. Check if a given a year is a leap year. The condition is:- year should be (divisible by 4
and not divisible by 100) or (divisible by 4 and divisible by 400.). The year should be
Selected from some table.

>	delimiter //
		create procedure leap()
		begin
			declare res date;
			select odate into res from orders_copy where onum = 3002;
			if (year(res) % 4 = 0 and year(res) % 100 != 0) or (year(res) % 4 = 0 and year(res) % 400 = 0) then
				insert into tempp values(concat(year(res)," is a leap year"));
			else
			  	insert into tempp values(concat(year(res)," is not a leap year"));
			 end if;

	delimiter ;

4. Write a program that Selects from any table two character strings. Your program should
then determine if one character string exists inside another character string.

>			create table str1(num int,Name varchar(20)); 
			insert into str1 values (1,'adi'),(2,'hrishi'),(3,'adinath'),(4,'hrishikesh');
			select * from str1;
			delimiter //
			create procedure checkst1(s1 int,s2 int)
			begin
					declare x varchar(20);
			        declare y varchar(20);
			        declare z varchar(50);
			        declare w varchar(50);
			        select name into x from str1 where num = s1;
			        select name into y from str1 where num = s2;
			        set z = concat('%',x,'%');
			         set w = concat('%',y,'%');
			        if  (y like z) or (x like w) then
							insert into tempp values("String Exits inside another string");
					else
							insert into tempp values("String does not exits in another String");
					end if;
			end; //
			delimiter ;
