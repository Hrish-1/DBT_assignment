Q4. Why isn't it possible to see the first five rows of a table ?
A : Because when we insert rows,the rows are stored in the server machine's 
    hard disk based on the available memory space, i.e in a random fashion.
    According to the ascending order of memory address. So it
    is not possible to see the first or last N rows of a table.
